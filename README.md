# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-SVM

This project implements an SVM classifier from scratch to classify MNIST handwritten digits (0-9) without using any SVM libraries. Key features include:

Support for Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels
One-vs-Rest strategy for multi-class classification
Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score
Visualization of misclassified digits and kernel performance comparison
